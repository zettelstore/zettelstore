A zettel consists of two part: the metadata and the zettel content.
Metadata gives some information mostly about the zettel content, how it should be interpreted, how it is sorted within Zettelstore.
The zettel content is, well, the actual content.
In many cases, the content is in plain text form.
Plain text is long-lasting.
However, content in binary format is also possible.

Metadata has to conform to a [[special syntax|00001006010000]].
It is effectively a collection of key/value pairs.
Some keys have a [[special meaning|00001006020000]] and most of the predefined keys need values of a specific [[type|00001006030000]].

Each zettel is given a unique [[identifier|00001006050000]].
To some degree, the zettel identifier is part of the metadata..

The zettel content is your valuable content.
Zettelstore contains some predefined parsers that interpret the zettel content to the syntax of the zettel.
This includes markup languages, like [[Zettelmarkup|00001007000000]] and [[CommonMark|https://commonmark.org/]].
Other text formats are also supported, like CSS and HTML templates.
Plain text content is always Unicode, encoded as UTF-8.
Other character encodings are not supported and will never be[^This is not a real problem, since every modern software should support UTF-8 as an encoding.].
There is support for a graphical format with a text represenation: SVG.
And the is support for some binary image formats, like GIF, PNG, and JPEG.
